This is my basic ricing of Arch Linux. It has basic features like tab drag and dropping, polybar with minimal applets, and some random applications like discord.


This is a picture of my applets I had collected on my modified polybar.

I am using Feh for my background manager, with polybar being modified to not be solid and having a 'useless' spacing, which works with the awesomeWM spacing.
